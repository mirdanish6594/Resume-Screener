# Resume Screener MLOps Project

## Overview

Resume Screener is an AI-powered MLOps project designed to automate the resume screening process for HR teams and recruitment portals. This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that can process resumes, extract relevant information, classify candidates based on job requirements, and provide analytics to optimize hiring decisions.

This README serves as detailed documentation covering the project's architecture, installation, usage, components, and future improvements.

## Project Motivation

Recruiting the right talent quickly is a critical business need. Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to human bias. This project automates resume evaluation, enabling faster, unbiased, and data-driven hiring decisions.

---

## Features

- Automated resume parsing and feature extraction
- Candidate classification using ML models
- Pipeline orchestration for data preprocessing, training, and inference
- Model versioning and deployment using Docker and cloud platforms
- Continuous model monitoring and retraining
- Scalable and reusable modular code design
- Web interface for HR users (planned)

---

## Architecture

The system is composed of several modules working together:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect resumes and job descriptions
2. **Data Processing**: Extract features from resumes (e.g., skills, experience)
3. **Model Training**: Train classification models with hyperparameter tuning
4. **Model Evaluation**: Validate model performance on test data
5. **Deployment**: Containerize models using Docker and deploy to cloud
6. **Monitoring**: Track model accuracy and drift, trigger retraining
7. **User Interface**: Web frontend for HR interaction (future)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Docker (optional but recommended for deployment)
- Cloud account (AWS/GCP/Azure) for model hosting (optional)

### Setup steps

1. Clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirdanish6594/Resume-Screener.git
cd Resume-Screener
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the initial bootstrapping script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This sets up the initial project structure and prepares data directories.

## Usage

### Running the pipeline

The main entry point `main.py` orchestrates the pipeline. You can run:

```bash
python main.py --train
python main.py --inference
```

### Project Structure

- `data/` - folder containing input resumes and job descriptions
- `src/` - source code for data processing, model training, evaluation
- `models/` - saved trained models and version control
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- `deployment/` - Dockerfiles and cloud deployment scripts

---

## Components

### Data Processing

- Parsing resumes (PDF/DOCX) using libraries like `pdfminer` or `python-docx`
- Extracting key information (skills, education, experience)
- Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF, embeddings

### Model Training

- Using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM for candidate classification
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` or `Optuna`
- Cross-validation to ensure model robustness

### MLOps Integration

- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Model versioning with MLflow or DVC
- Monitoring models for performance degradation

### Deployment

- Docker containerization of models and APIs
- Serving models via Flask/FastAPI REST endpoints
- Deployment on cloud services (AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, Azure App Service)

---

## Data Processing Pipeline

- Load raw resumes and job descriptions
- Clean and preprocess text (remove stopwords, stemming)
- Feature engineering (skills extraction, keyword matching)
- Vectorize features using TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Split data into train/test sets

---

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Train ML classifiers on the processed dataset
- Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Save best performing model to `models/` directory
- Use model explainability tools (SHAP, LIME) for insights

---

## MLOps Practices

- Automate data and model validation tests
- Use CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for deployment
- Implement logging and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Set up model retraining schedules based on drift detection

---

## Deployment

- Build Docker images for model serving
- Push images to container registries (DockerHub, ECR)
- Deploy to cloud platforms with autoscaling
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask/FastAPI for API serving
- Docker, Kubernetes (optional)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Git, GitHub for version control
